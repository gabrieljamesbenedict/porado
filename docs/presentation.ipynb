    "## 1. Interpreter Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lexer (Tokenizer)**  \n",
    "   - Converts raw source code into a stream of tokens.\n",
    "   - Recognizes keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and delimiters.\n",
    "   - Handles basic lexical errors, such as invalid characters or malformed literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parser (Syntax Analyzer)**  \n",
    "   - Builds an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** from the token stream.\n",
    "   - Uses a **recursive descent parsing** approach, with separate functions for statements, expressions, loops, conditionals, and function declarations.\n",
    "   - Ensures the code is syntactically correct and organizes the program into hierarchical nodes for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Executor (Interpreter Engine / Semantic Analyzer)**  \n",
    "   - Traverses the AST and evaluates nodes based on their type.\n",
    "   - Performs **type checking**, variable scope management, and function call resolution.\n",
    "   - Executes operations, assignments, control flow statements, loops, and print statements.\n",
    "   - Throws runtime errors for semantic violations (e.g., type mismatch, undefined variable)."
